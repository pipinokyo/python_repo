3 * 5 

# standard division
6 / 2 = 3.0  # afStandard Division always produces a float number, even when you divide two integers.
7 / 2 = 3.5

# integer division
# Integer division always returns the nearest whole number rounded down.
6 // 2 = 3
7 // 2 = 3
# But if at least one of the input numbers is a float, you will get a float instead.



# modulus division
# Modulus Division returns the remainder of the division
6 % 2 = 0  #  because 6 = 2 * 3 + 0
7 % 2 = 1  #  because 7 = 2 * 3 + 1

# Please always keep in mind that you can't divide by zero.
# If you do that with any of the division operators, you'll get an error.


# power operator
2 ** 3 = 8 # this means power of 2   2 * 2 * 2 = 8
