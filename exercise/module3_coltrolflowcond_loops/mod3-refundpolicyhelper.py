# Refund Policy Helper
# Let's help an online store with their new refund policy. In this store, you can return an item and get a refund in 2 cases:
# 1. Within 10 days from the day of purchase, given that you have not used the item, or
# 2. No matter when you bought it, when the item broke down through no fault of your own.
# Write a program that first asks the user three questions and then informs them whether they can get a refund. Ask the following questions:

# How many days ago have you purchased the item? << add a space at the end of this prompt

# Have you used the item at all [y/n]?  << add a space at the end of this prompt

# Has the item broken down on its own [y/n]?  << add a space at the end of this prompt

# Based on the answers and the refund policy explained above, print either:
# You can get a refund.
# or:
# You cannot get a refund.

days = int(input('How many days ago have you purchased the item? '))
if days < 10:
    used = input('Have you used the item at all [y/n]?')
    if used == 'n':
        broken = input('Has the item broken down on its own [y/n]? ')
        if broken == 'y':
            print('You can get a refund.')
        else:
                print('You cannot get a refund.')
    else:
        print('You cannot get a refund.')
else:
    print ('You cannot get a refund.')



purchase_days_ago = int(input('How many days ago have you purchased the item? '))
is_used = input('Have you used the item at all [y/n]? ')
is_broken = input('Has the item broken down on its own [y/n]? ')

if(is_broken == 'y' or (purchase_days_ago <= 10 and is_used == 'n')):
    print('You can get a refund.')
