# let's create a simple function that prints a greeting message
# a function definition starts with the keyword def, which is short for define.
# Then after a space we provide the function's name.
def greet():
  print('Hello, my dear!')
# this is a simple function that prints a greeting message
# we can call this function by using its name followed by parentheses
greet()  # this will print 'Hello, my dear!'
# we can call this function as many times as we want
