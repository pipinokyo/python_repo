# How many elements does the L list contain?

L = [i for i in range(-1, -2)]

# Understanding the Range
# The key to solving this is understanding how range(-1, -2) works:

# range(start, stop) generates numbers starting at start and ending just before stop.

# For range(-1, -2), it would generate numbers starting at -1 and going up to (but not including) -2.

# Visualizing the Range
# Let's see what numbers this range would produce:

# range(-1, -2):
#   Start at -1
#   Next number would be -1 + 1 = 0 (but 0 > -2, so we stop)
# This means range(-1, -2) produces no numbers because -1 is already greater than -2 (when counting downward).

# The Resulting List
# The list comprehension [i for i in range(-1, -2)] will therefore create an empty list because the range produces no values.

# Visualization

# range(-1, -2):
#   Attempt to generate first number: -1
#   Is -1 < -2? No (-1 is greater than -2)
#   Therefore, stop immediately

# Resulting list: []
# Correct Answer
# The list L contains zero elements.
