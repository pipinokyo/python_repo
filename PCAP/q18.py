# What is the expected behavior of the following snippet?
a = 'hello' # line 1
def x(a,b): # line 2
    z = a[0] # line 3
    return z # line 4
print(x(a)) # line 5


# Step-by-Step Execution:
# Line 1:

# A variable a is assigned the string value 'hello'.

# State: a = 'hello'

# Line 2-4:

# A function x is defined with two parameters: a and b.

# The function takes the first character of a (i.e., a[0]) and returns it.

# Function definition: x(a, b) -> returns a[0]

# Line 5:

# The function x is called with only one argument: x(a).

# The function x expects two arguments (a and b), but only one is provided.

# This will raise a TypeError because the function is missing a required positional argument b.
