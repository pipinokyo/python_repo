# What value will be assigned to the x variable?

z = 3
y = 7
x = y < z and z > y or y > z and z < y

# Evaluating Comparisons
# y < z:
# y = 7, z = 3
# Is 7 < 3? No.
# So, y < z is False.

# z > y:
# z = 3, y = 7
# Is 3 > 7? No.
# So, z > y is False.

# y > z:
# y = 7, z = 3
# Is 7 > 3? Yes.
# So, y > z is True.

# z < y:
# z = 3, y = 7
# Is 3 < 7? Yes.
# So, z < y is True.

# Now, substitute these values back into the expression:
# x = (False and False) or (True and True)

# Evaluating and Operations
# The and operator returns True only if both operands are True; otherwise, it returns False.

# False and False:
# False and False is False.
# True and True:
# True and True is True.

# Now, the expression simplifies to:
# x = False or True

# Evaluating or Operation
# The or operator returns True if at least one of the operands is True; otherwise, it returns False.

# False or True:
# Since one of them is True, the result is True.

# Final Value of x
# After all these evaluations:

# x = True

# So, the value assigned to x is True.
