# What is the expected output of the following snippet?
a = 0
b = a ** 0
if b < a + 1:
    c = 1
elif b == 1:
    c = 2
else:
    c = 3
print(a + b + c)


# Initialization
# a = 0
# a is assigned the value 0.

# Calculation of b
# b = a ** 0
# a ** 0 means 0 raised to the power of0.
# In Python, 0 ** 0 is defined as 1 (although mathematically this is an indeterminate form).
# So, b = 1.

# If-elif-else Block
# Now, we evaluate the conditions in the if-elif-else block:

# First condition:
# if b < a + 1:
    # c = 1
# b is 1, and a + 1 is 0 + 1 = 1.
# The condition is 1 < 1, which is False. So, we move to the elif.

# Second condition (elif):
# elif b == 1:
    # c = 2
# b is 1, so 1 == 1 is True.

# Thus, c is assigned 2.
# The else block is skipped because the elif condition was satisfied.

# Final Calculation
# print(a + b + c)
# a is 0, b is 1, and c is 2.
# 0 + 1 + 2 = 3.

# Output
# The output of the code is:3
