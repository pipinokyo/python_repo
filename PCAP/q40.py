# What is the expected output of the following code?

x = 1 // 5 + 1 / 5
print(x)

# Explanation with Visualization:
# 1. Breakdown of the Expression (1 // 5 + 1 / 5):
# 1 // 5 → Floor Division (returns the largest integer ≤ exact division result)

# 1 / 5 = 0.2 → 1 // 5 = 0 (since 0 is the largest integer ≤ 0.2)

# 1 / 5 → True Division (returns a float)

# 1 / 5 = 0.2

# Final Calculation:

# 0 (from //) + 0.2 (from /) = 0.2

# 2. Step-by-Step Execution:
# Step 1: 1 // 5 → 0 (floor division discards the decimal)
# Step 2: 1 / 5 → 0.2 (true division keeps the decimal)
# Step 3: 0 + 0.2 → 0.2
# Step 4: print(0.2) → Output: 0.2
# Visualization:
# Expression: x = 1 // 5 + 1 / 5

# 1 // 5 → 0   (since 1 ÷ 5 = 0.2, floor division truncates to 0)
# 1 / 5  → 0.2 (normal division keeps the decimal)

# Now, add them:
# 0 + 0.2 = 0.2

# Final value of x: 0.2
# Output: 0.2
# Key Takeaways:
# // (Floor Division) → Always returns an integer (rounded down).

# Example: 7 // 2 = 3, -7 // 2 = -4 (rounds toward negative infinity).

# / (True Division) → Always returns a float (keeps decimal precision).

# Order of Operations → Since // and / have the same precedence, they are evaluated left-to-right.

# Why Not 0 or 1?
# If you mistakenly thought // and / behave the same, you might expect 0 (0 + 0).

# If you misapplied operator precedence, you might expect 1 (1 // (5 + 1) / 5 → 1 // 6 / 5 → 0 / 5 → 0.0).

# Correct Output: 0.2 because // and / are computed separately before addition.

# Final Answer:
# The output is 0.2.
