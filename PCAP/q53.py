# What is the expected output of the following code?

x = '\''
print(len(x))


# Understanding the Code
# String Assignment: x = '\''

# Here, x is being assigned a string value. The string is defined within single quotes ' '.

# Inside the string, there is a backslash \ followed by another single quote '.

# The backslash \ is an escape character in Python, which means it changes the meaning of the character that follows it.

# In this case, \' is an escape sequence that represents a literal single quote ' character (it's a way to include a single quote inside a single-quoted string).

# String Content:

# Without the escape character, x = ''' would be invalid because Python would interpret the second single quote as the end of the string, leaving the third single quote without a pair, causing a syntax error.

# With the escape character, \' is treated as a single ' character inside the string. So, the string x contains exactly one character: '.

# Length of the String: len(x)

# The len() function returns the number of characters in the string x.

# Since x contains only one character ('), len(x) will return 1.

# Visualization
# Let's visualize the string assignment:

# x = '\''
# Breaking it down:

# The string is enclosed in single quotes: ' '.

# Inside the string: \'

# \ is the escape character.

# \' together is interpreted as a single ' character.

# So, the string x can be visualized as:

# x = | ' |
# Where | | represents the boundaries of the string, and ' is the single character inside it.

# Expected Output
# When you run the code:

# x = '\''
# print(len(x))
# The output will be:

# 1
