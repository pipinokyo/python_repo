# How many stars will the following code print to the monitor?

i = 0
while i < 3:
    i += 2
    print('*')


# Initial State:
# i = 0

# While Loop Condition: i < 3
# The loop will continue as long as i is less than 3.

# Iteration 1:
# Check condition: i < 3 → 0 < 3 → True

# Enter the loop body.

# Execute i += 2:

# i = 0 + 2 → i = 2

# Execute print('*'):

# Prints * (1st star)

# End of iteration 1:

# Now i = 2

# Iteration 2:
# Check condition: i < 3 → 2 < 3 → True

# Enter the loop body.

# Execute i += 2:

# i = 2 + 2 → i = 4

# Execute print('*'):

# Prints * (2nd star)

# End of iteration 2:

# Now i = 4

# Iteration 3:
# Check condition: i < 3 → 4 < 3 → False

# Loop terminates.

# Summary:
# The loop runs 2 times, printing a star (*) each time.

# The final value of i is 4.

# Output:
# *
