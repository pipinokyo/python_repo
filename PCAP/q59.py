# What happens if you run the following code, assuming that the d directory already exists?

import os
os.mkdir("a/b/c/d")

# os.mkdir() creates a single directory.

# It requires that all parent directories already exist (unlike os.makedirs(), which creates parent directories recursively).

# If any parent directory in the path does not exist, os.mkdir() raises a FileNotFoundError.

# Step-by-Step Execution:
# import os:

# Imports Python's os module, which provides operating system-dependent functionality (like directory creation).

# os.mkdir("a/b/c/d"):

# The code attempts to create directory d inside a/b/c/.

# But os.mkdir() does not create missing parent directories (a, b, c).

# If any of a, b, or c do not exist, the operation fails.

# Expected Behavior:
# If a/b/c/ already exists:

# d is successfully created inside a/b/c/.

# No errors occur.

# If a/, a/b/, or a/b/c/ do not exist:

# Python raises a FileNotFoundError because os.mkdir() cannot create intermediate directories.

# Example error:

# FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/b/c/d'
