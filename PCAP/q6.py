# What is the result of the following comparison?
x = "20"
y = "30"
print(x > y)

# Explanation:
# String Comparison: When comparing strings in Python, the comparison is done lexicographically (i.e., character by character based on their Unicode code points, similar to dictionary order).

# Character-by-Character Comparison:
# First, the first characters of the two strings are compared: "2" (from x) and "3" (from y).
# The Unicode code point of "2" is 50, and the Unicode code point of "3" is 51.
# Since 50 (for "2") is less than 51 (for "3"), the string "20" is considered less than "30".

# Result: Thus, x > y evaluates to False because "20" is lexicographically less than "30".
