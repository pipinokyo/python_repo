# What is the expected output of the following snippet?
lst1 = "12,34"
lst2 = lst1.split(',')
print(len(lst1) < len(lst2))

# 1. Initial Setup
# We start with:

# lst1 = "12,34"
# lst1 is a string with the value "12,34".
# This string has 5 characters: '1', '2', ',', '3', '4'.

# 2. Splitting the String
# Next, we split lst1 using split(','):
# lst2 = lst1.split(',')
# split(',') splits the string at the comma (,) and returns a list of substrings.
# "12,34" splits into ["12", "34"] (a list with 2 elements).

# 3. Comparing Lengths
# Now, we compare the lengths:
# print(len(lst1) < len(lst2))
# len(lst1) → Length of the original string "12,34" = 5 (since it has 5 characters).
# len(lst2) → Length of the split list ["12", "34"] = 2 (since it has 2 elements).

# 4. Evaluating the Condition
# The condition being checked is:
# len(lst1) < len(lst2)
# Which translates to:

# 5 < 2
# This is False, so the output is False.
