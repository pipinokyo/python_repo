# What is the expected output of the following snippet?
lst = [i // i for i in range(0,4)]
sum = 0
for n in lst:
    sum += n
print(sum)

# Explanation:
# 1. List Comprehension: [i // i for i in range(0,4)]
# This creates a list lst by iterating over i in range(0,4) (which is [0, 1, 2, 3]).
# For each i, it calculates i // i (integer division of i by itself).

# 2. Evaluation of i // i:
# When i = 0:
# 0 // 0 raises a ZeroDivisionError because division by zero is undefined in mathematics and Python.

# For other values:
# i = 1: 1 // 1 = 1
# i = 2: 2 // 2 = 1
# i = 3: 3 // 3 = 1

# 3. Expected Behavior:
# The list comprehension will fail immediately when i = 0 because of ZeroDivisionError.

# Thus, the code does not proceed to the loop or print(sum).

# 4. Error Output:
# The program crashes with:

# ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
