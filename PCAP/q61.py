# You develop a Python application for your company. You have the following code.

def main(a, b, c, d):
    value = a + b * c - d
    return value

# Which of the following expressions is equivalent to the expression in the function?


# Python Operator Precedence:
# Multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-)

# Addition and subtraction have the same precedence and evaluate left-to-right

# Evaluation Order:
# First: b * c (multiplication)

# Then: a + (result of b * c) (addition)

# Finally: (result of previous operation) - d (subtraction)

# Equivalent Expressions:
# Without seeing your specific options, the most likely equivalent expressions would be:

# (a + (b * c)) - d - Explicitly showing the precedence with parentheses

# a + (b * c) - d - Same as above but with minimal parentheses
