# What is the expected output of the following code?

v = [1, 2, 3]

def g(a,b,m):
    return m(a,b)

print(g(1,1, lambda x,y: v[x:y+1]))


# Understanding the Code
# List v:

# v = [1, 2, 3] defines a list v with three elements: 1, 2, and 3.

# Function g(a, b, m):

# This function takes three arguments:

# a (an integer)

# b (an integer)

# m (a function, in this case, a lambda function)

# It simply calls the function m with arguments a and b and returns the result.

# Lambda Function lambda x, y: v[x:y+1]:

# This is an anonymous function (lambda) that takes x and y and returns a slice of v from index x to y+1.

# Python slicing v[x:y+1] includes elements from index x up to (but not including) y+1.

# Function Call g(1, 1, lambda x, y: v[x:y+1]):

# Here, g is called with:

# a = 1

# b = 1

# m = lambda x, y: v[x:y+1]

# Inside g, m(a, b) executes the lambda function with x = 1 and y = 1.

# Step-by-Step Evaluation
# Lambda Execution:

# The lambda function is called with x = 1 and y = 1.

# The slice v[x:y+1] becomes v[1:2] (since y+1 = 2).

# v[1:2] extracts elements from index 1 to 2 (excluding 2), which is [2].

# Return Value:

# The lambda returns [2], and g returns this result.

# Visualization
# v = [1, 2, 3]
# Indices: 0:1, 1:2, 2:3

# g(1, 1, lambda x, y: v[x:y+1]) → m(1, 1) → lambda(1, 1) → v[1:2] → [2]

# Expected Output
# When you run the code:
# v = [1, 2, 3]

# def g(a, b, m):
#     return m(a, b)

# print(g(1, 1, lambda x, y: v[x:y+1]))
# The output will be: [2]
