    # What is the expected output of the following code?

    class Content:
        title = "None"
        
        def __init__(self, this):
            self.name = this + " than " + Content.title

    text_1 = Content("Paper")
    text_2 = Content("Article")
    print(text_1.title == text_2.name)

# Explanation with Visualization:
# 1. Class Structure:
# Class Variable (title):

# title = "None" is a class-level variable shared by all instances of Content.

# Instance Variable (name):

# The __init__ method assigns self.name based on the input this and the class variable title.

# 2. Instance Creation:
# text_1 = Content("Paper")

# self.name = "Paper" + " than " + "None" → name = "Paper than None"

# text_1.title (class variable) remains "None".

# text_2 = Content("Article")

# self.name = "Article" + " than " + "None" → name = "Article than None"

# text_2.title (class variable) remains "None".

# 3. Comparison (text_1.title == text_2.name):
# text_1.title → "None" (class variable)

# text_2.name → "Article than None" (instance variable)

# Comparison: "None" == "Article than None" → False

# Visualization:
# Class Content:
#     title (class variable) = "None"

#     __init__(self, this):
#         self.name = this + " than " + Content.title

# text_1:
#     name = "Paper than None" (instance variable)
#     title = "None" (inherited from class)

# text_2:
#     name = "Article than None" (instance variable)
#     title = "None" (inherited from class)

# Comparison:
#     text_1.title ("None") == text_2.name ("Article than None") → False
# Final Answer:
# The output is False.
