# What is the expected output of the following code?

x = 9 
y = 12
result = x // 2 * 2 / 2 + y % 2 ** 3
print(result)

# Step-by-Step Evaluation:
# Understand the variables:
# x = 9
# y = 12
# Evaluate the expression x // 2 * 2 / 2:
# Operator precedence: // (floor division) and * (multiplication) have the same precedence and are evaluated left to right. / (division) has lower precedence.
# x // 2: Floor division of 9 by 2:
# 9 // 2 = 4 (since 2 * 4 = 8, which is the largest multiple of 2 less than or equal to 9)
# Now multiply by 2:
# 4 * 2 = 8
# Now divide by 2:
# 8 / 2 = 4.0 (division in Python returns a float)
# Evaluate the expression y % 2 ** 3:
# Operator precedence: ** (exponentiation) has higher precedence than % (modulo).
# 2 ** 3: Exponentiation:
# 2 ** 3 = 8
# Now compute y % 8 (modulo of 12 by 8):
# 12 % 8 = 4 (since 8 goes into 12 once, leaving a remainder of 4)
# Combine the two parts with +:
# 4.0 + 4 = 8.0

# Final Output:
# The output of print(result) will be:
# 8.0

# Visualization:
# text
# x = 9
# y = 12

# result = x // 2 * 2 / 2 + y % 2 ** 3
#        = (9 // 2) * 2 / 2 + (12 % (2 ** 3))
#        = 4 * 2 / 2 + (12 % 8)
#        = 8 / 2 + 4
#        = 4.0 + 4
#        = 8.0

# The expected output of the code is:
8.0
