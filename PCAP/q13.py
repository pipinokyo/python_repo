# What would you insert instead of ??? so that the program prints 1024 to the monitor?
Code:
lst = [2 ** x for x in range(0, 11)]
print(lst???)
Expected output:
1024

# to print 1024 from the list lst = [2 ** x for x in range(0, 11)], we need to access the last element of the list. Here's how we can do it step by step:

# 1. Understand the List Construction
# The list comprehension [2 ** x for x in range(0, 11)] generates a list where each element is 2 raised to the power of x, for x ranging from 0 to 10 (inclusive).

# Let's compute the values:

# x = 0: 2 ** 0 = 1

# x = 1: 2 ** 1 = 2

# x = 2: 2 ** 2 = 4

# x = 3: 2 ** 3 = 8

# x = 4: 2 ** 4 = 16

# x = 5: 2 ** 5 = 32

# x = 6: 2 ** 6 = 64

# x = 7: 2 ** 7 = 128

# x = 8: 2 ** 8 = 256

# x = 9: 2 ** 9 = 512

# x = 10: 2 ** 10 = 1024

# So, lst = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024].

# 2. Access the Last Element (1024)
# We need to print 1024, which is the last element of lst. In Python, we can access the last element of a list in multiple ways:

# Negative indexing: lst[-1]

# -1 refers to the last element, -2 the second last, etc.

# Explicit index: lst[10]

# Since the list has 11 elements (indices 0 to 10), lst[10] is 1024.
