# What is the expected output of the following code?

x = lambda a, b: a ** b
print(x(2, 10))

# Step-by-Step Explanation:
# 1. Lambda Function Definition:
# lambda a, b: a ** b creates an anonymous (unnamed) function that takes two arguments a and b and returns the result of a ** b (a raised to the power of b).

# This lambda function is assigned to the variable x. So, x now holds this function.

# Equivalent regular function:
# def x(a, b):
#     return a ** b
# 2. Calling the Lambda Function:
# x(2, 10) calls the lambda function with a = 2 and b = 10.

# The function computes 2 ** 10 (2 raised to the power of 10).

# 3. Calculating 2 ** 10:
# 2 ** 10 means 2 multiplied by itself 10 times:

# 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2

# 4. Output:
# The result of 2 ** 10 is 1024, which is passed to the print function.
# The output of the code is: 1024
