# What will be the output of the following code snippet?

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(a[::2])


# Output of the Code Snippet:

# [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
# Explanation with Visualization:
# The code uses list slicing with a step (a[::2]), which means:

# Start (:): From the beginning of the list (index 0).

# Stop (:): Until the end of the list.

# Step (2): Skip every second element (select every alternate element).

# Step-by-Step Visualization:
# Let’s index the list for clarity:

# Index	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8
# Value	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9
# Start at index 0 → 1 (selected).

# Skip index 1 (2), move to index 2 → 3 (selected).

# Skip index 3 (4), move to index 4 → 5 (selected).

# Skip index 5 (6), move to index 6 → 7 (selected).

# Skip index 7 (8), move to index 8 → 9 (selected).

# Final Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
