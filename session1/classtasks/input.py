# to see the data type: print(type(???))

num1 = input("Please provide number1: ")
num2 = input("Please provide number2: ")

print(int(num1) + int(num2))

# to do the same task by using number with decimal points use(float)
# intead of (int)
# if you do not convert tha data and use strings it will add then 
# to each other called string concatination
